# End-to-End Machine Learning Project (Practice)

This repository contains a toy **end-to-end machine learning project** built to understand the **Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)**.  
The goal of this project is not to achieve state-of-the-art results, but to get hands-on practice with the **workflow of ML projects** from start to finish.

## üìå Project Overview
The dataset used is related to **student placements**.  
The objective is to build a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a student gets placed based on their academic and skill-related features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Involved (ML Lifecycle)
This project follows the typical ML development life cycle:

1. **Problem Definition**  
   - Define business problem: Predict placement outcome (placed vs not placed).  
   - Identify dataset and target variable.

2. **Data Collection**  
   - Loaded dataset (`placement.csv`).  

3. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
   - Checked missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.  
   - Dropped unnecessary columns.  
   - Handled categorical and numerical features.  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Plotted distributions and relationships between features.  

5. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Selected relevant features.  
   - Performed transformations if required.

6. **Model Building**  
   - Trained multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).  
   - Used train-test split for evaluation.

7. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Compared performance across models.

8. **Conclusion**  
   - Selected the best-performing model.  
   - Summarized findings.
